# Lucky7

## Overview

_Lucky Seven is played with seven numbered cards (per player 1 - 7) on a flat surface. The goal of the game is to turn all seven cards number side up, to accrue the most points.  The cards are shuffled and laid face down.  The player will choose the first card and the reveal the number underneath.  The number represents the next position of the card the player must turn face up.  The player wins when all 7 cards are turned face up.  The player will lose if the card is already face up._

**_Challenges_**

I have never heard of this game before the project.  I needed to complete research to discover the rules of play including how winner is determined / how points are scored.  Once research was completed I broke the project down into 3 parts.  
* Container 
* Game Elements
* Game Function and Scoring

**_My Thoughts_**

This was one of the final projects in my Java II class.  The program is a great example of my understanding and practical application of object-oriented programming concepts. It uses methods effectively to capture Object Orientation and extends the JPanel with the implements ActionListener to demonstrate my understanding of inheritance. The program utilizes a variety of nested loops to effectively handle a multitude of tasks from loading and changing arrays, building / loading / assigning properties to objects, making decisions and analyzing information. The program required a large majority of the skills I learned during both my Java I & II classes to complete.  I feel that this is a good barometer of type of work that I deliver.  

**_Changes_**

There is a bunch of things that I am proud of in this program, but I would still make significant changes.  
* I would want to make the game a multi-player game with players alternating turns with scores being displayed after every turn.  
* I would also create a file that could hold player stats to track overall play over time.  
* Also I would add additional graphics and animations to increase the overall appeal and playability.
